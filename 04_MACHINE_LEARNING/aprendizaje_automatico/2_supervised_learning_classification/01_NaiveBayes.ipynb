NumPy offers speedy computation and execution of complicated functions working on arrays. Few of the points in favor of NumPy are:\n","\n","- Support for mathematical and logical operations\n","- Shape manipulation\n","- Sorting and Selecting capabilities\n","- Discrete Fourier transformations\n","- Basic linear algebra and statistical operations\n","- Random simulations\n","- Support for n-dimensional arrays\n","\n","NumPy works on an object-oriented approach and has tools for integrating C, C++ and Fortran code, and this makes NumPy highly popular amongst the scientific community.\n","\n","### [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)\n","\n","Pandas is a Python data analysis library and is used primarily for data manipulation and analysis. It comes into play before the dataset is prepared for training. Pandas make working with time series and structured multidimensional data effortless for machine-learning programmers. Some of the great features of Pandas when it comes to handling data are:\n","\n","- Dataset reshaping and pivoting\n","- Merging and joining of datasets\n","- Handling of missing data and data alignment\n","- Various indexing options such as Hierarchical axis indexing, Fancy indexing\n","- Data filtration options\n","\n","Pandas makes use of DataFrames, which is just a technical term for a two-dimensional representation of data by offering programmers with DataFrame objects.\n","\n","### [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)\n","\n","Scikit-learn is a very actively used machine learning library for Python. It includes easy integration with different ML programming libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Scikit-learn comes with the support of various algorithms such as:\n","\n","- Classification\n","- Regression\n","- Clustering\n","- Dimensionality Reduction\n","- Model Selection\n","- Preprocessing\n","\n","Built around the idea of being easy to use but still be flexible, Scikit-learn is focussed on data modelling and not on other tasks such as loading, handling, manipulation and visualization of data. It is considered sufficient enough to be used as an end-to-end ML, from the research phase to the deployment.\n","\n","### [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)\n","\n","Simply put, matplotlib is a plotting library. If you’ve ever used MATLAB before, you’ll probably feel very comfortable in the matplotlib environment. When analyzing images, we’ll make use of matplotlib, whether plotting the overall accuracy of search systems or simply viewing the image itself, matplotlib is a great tool to have in your toolbox.\n","\n","Matplotlib is a comprehensive data visualization library in Python. Some features include:\n","\n","- creating interactive plots.\n","- offering flexible customization of the plot.\n","\n","It is a foundation library supporting seaborn, which is easier to use. But when we want to customize the plots more, matplotlib becomes necessary. It's also useful for quick tests and visualizations.\n","\n","### [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)\n","\n","Seaborn is a popular Python library for making statistical data visualizations. It is based on matplotlib and also integrated with pandas data structures.\n","\n","Seaborn is especially useful for exploring and understanding data. Some of the functionalities that seaborn offers:\n","\n","- options for visualizing univariate and bivariate distributions.\n","- options for visualizing numerical and categorical variables.\n","- automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models.\n","- ability to build complex visualizations such as multi-plot grids.\n","\n","It comes in handy whenever whe need to explore a dataset with Histograms, Heatmaps, Scatter plots, Barplots, etc.\n","\n","\n","This is a general introduction of each of the libraries we will use.
